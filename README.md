# PBibFix

A Pocketbook Application designed to fix entries in PocketBook's Library (Bibliothek) database.

## Rationale

PocketBook is very picky about metadata found in epubs.

* Infos about book series can only be found when they are in a specific order.
* Author names can only be found if the XML namespace is exactly `opf`

These are the first two issues this application is going to fix.

## Installation

Copy PBibFix to your pocketbook's applications directory.
Use it each time you copied new books onto the device or at least each time
you found a mistake in the library.

## WAIT

I didn't write anything yet ;) So stay tuned for updatesâ€¦
